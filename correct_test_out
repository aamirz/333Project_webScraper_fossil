[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Judge David Tatel, former Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court Deborah Poritz, and Fordham University Professor of Law Jed Shugerman discussed the issues behind the nomination and confirmation of federal and state judges and proposed solutions to break the partisan logjams in the appointment process. The conversation was moderated by Leslie Gerwin, the University\u2019s Associate Director of the Program in Law and Public Affairs.\n\nTatel began by discussing the increased partisanship involved in the process of nominating and confirming judges to the U.S. Supreme Court. He showed the audience a graph, which plotted the average number of \"no\" votes cast for each judge nominated to the Supreme Court during three periods of American history.\n\nFrom 1789 to 1967, the average number of \"no\" votes per judge was four, and Tatel noted that most judges were confirmed unanimously. This trend changed after 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The U.S. Senate rejected Fortas' nomination, since he had personally advised President Johnson. In addition, Tatel said that 1968 was a pivotal year, as the height of President Richard Nixon's \"Southern Strategy\" during the 1968 presidential election. \n\nThese events help explain why there were four times as many \"no\" votes on Supreme Court nominations from 1967 to 2006. The final time period, 2006 to today, featured twice as many \"no\" votes as the period from 1967 to 2006. Tatel pointed out that the last three justices to be nominated and confirmed to the Supreme Court, Associate Justices Samuel Alito '72, Sonia Sotomayor '76, and Elena Kagan '81, were all confirmed on partisan lines. \n\n\"Why do nominations go from nonpartisan to partisan?\" Tatel said. \"The reason, I think, is that the country no longer sees our courts as institutions that decide cases based on the law. Decisions are unaffected by the parties\u2019 or judges\u2019 ideology or affiliation. Courts are seen as places where judges use their ideology to get a result you can\u2019t get in the political realm.\"\n\nTatel then spoke about his court, the D.C. Circuit, and explained that the selection of judges to this court mirrors that of the nomination process for the U.S. Supreme Court, but that there is no senatorial courtesy. He displayed a chart showing statistics about judges nominated to the D.C. Circuit from 1981 onward, specifically focusing on the number of \"no\" votes and the length of time each nomination was pending. \n\nTatel said that there were some takeaways from this graph. The first is that prior to 1995, every nominee to the D.C. Circuit was confirmed in a relatively short amount of time and virtually unanimously. After 1995, Tatel noted that there were six failed nominations, and the ones who were confirmed were confirmed on partisan lines and took a longer time to be confirmed.\n\nMost notably, the last three nominees to the D.C. Circuit were confirmed only after the Senate invoked the \"nuclear option,\" which ended the filibuster and enabled the judges to be confirmed by simple majority vote. Tatel pointed out that again, these confirmation votes occurred on mostly partisan lines.\n\nTatel finished by pointing to the recent confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, which featured Senators asking Gorsuch how he would rule on certain cases, as well as the statements from 2016 presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on how they would use litmus tests to select judges to the Supreme Court to illustrate the increasing partisanship of confirmation votes.\n\nPoritz began her remarks by talking about the importance of state courts, since most people don't know much about them. She explained that state courts decide 95 percent of cases in the United States and create the public perception of justice. She noted that state courts also decide cases on redistricting for elections at the state and national level. Poritz pointed out that certain states elect their judges, so there is a high amount of money spent campaigning for judges who could be the deciding vote on high profile cases, including redistricting. \n\n\"State courts are involved in redistricting, which is in part why there\u2019s been a particular interest in states where judges are elected both in what kind of decisions those judges are making, and the role that those courts play in the redistricting process,\" she said.\n\nThe event, titled \"Selecting Judges in the Trump Era,\" was sponsored by the Program in Law and Public Affairs and held at 4:30 p.m. at Dodds Auditorium, Robertson Hall.\n\n", "author": "Abhiram Karuppur", "title": "Two judges and a law professor discuss selecting judges in the Trump era"}]
[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "Often, one of the biggest challenges conservationists face is the conflict between local communities and the surrounding wildlife \u2014 especially in a country with a billion people. Conservation biologist Krithi Karanth, explaining her work at a lecture Monday, has devoted her life to addressing this problem in India.\n\n\u201cI got a first-hand view of how amazing it is to watch animals and be outside in nature,\" Karanth said. She explained that her childhood experiences with wildlife and wildlife reserves inspired her work today. \n\n\u201cI had a very unusual childhood,\" Karanth said. \"My dad was a wildlife biologist and he started taking me to the jungle when I was a year old.\u201d\n\nKaranth explained how she would spend hours with her father watching wildlife from his Jeep while studying. Karanth also said that she learned patience and witnessed the uglier sides of conservation. For example, Karanth explained how an angry group of local people destroyed a research facility in response to a poacher's arrest. This confrontation, she said, is an example of how conservation affects local communities. Initially, the confrontation actually deterred Karanth from conservation work. Luckily, Karanth said, she eventually returned to the cause.\n\nNow, her work is devoted to providing safe habitats for animals. After doing research, Karanth saw shockingly uneven facts. First, in locations such as Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, and India, less than 3 to 5 percent of land is set aside for animal life.\n\n\u201cOur battle to save nature is on the front lines in places like this,\" she said. \n\nKaranth talked about how her colleagues working in the Amazon and in the African continent have the luxury of fighting for 10 to 15 thousand square kilometers of land for the animals. Karanth was fighting for merely hundreds of square kilometers in the areas in which she worked, mainly in India. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is those areas we do have [in India] are very fragmented, very distant, and still are holding 70 percent of the world\u2019s tigers, 50 percent of the world\u2019s elephants, and a whole lot of other species,\" she noted .\n\nKaranth\u2019s work often deals with conflict between humans and wildlife. Specifically, Karanth said her main opponent to animal conservation is frequently to the desire communities have to retaliate against animals destroying their crops and housing and even occasionally injuring and killing humans.\n\nAccording to Karanth, there are 81,100 incidents of animals harming humans or otherwise interfering with humans\u2019 lives reported in India. Karanth said that this number accounts for only 30 percent of the actual number of incidents in India. What\u2019s more, only 5.3 million dollars are allocated for compensating those individuals who fall victim to these incidents, she said.\n\nKaranth cited the overwhelming amount of bureaucracy and paperwork as the main cause of a reluctance to report incidents and thus a desire on the part of communities to take matters into their own hands. As a result, Karanth has set in place a variety of measures to calm the people down and lessen their hurt and anger.\n\nKaranth combats this issue mainly through a program of her creation called Wild Seve. On behalf of affected communities, the program will respond to incident reports and file the necessary paperwork for compensation in an effort to increase report percentages and decrease the number of personal retaliations. When asked about the efficacy of this program, Karanth explained that all anecdotal evidence has pointed to the organization's success. People reporting incidents now frequently  refuse to make any decisions without having consulted Wild Seve first, she said.\n\nKaranth also mentioned a program in which she helps relocate willing families in an effort to establish wildlife reserves. The program has helped over 1,500 families resettle and acclimate to a new community, she said. She emphasizes, however, that conservation efforts should not negatively impact humans for the sake of animals, but instead make the situation advantageous for both parties. \n\n\u201cGoing forward, the challenge is fostering tolerance and sustaining wildlife,\" she said.\n\nKaranth's lecture, titled \u201cConserving Wildlife Amidst a Billion People: Challenges and Solutions,\" took place at 4:30 p.m. in 10 Guyot Hall as part of the EEB 522 seminar series. \n\n", "author": "Jackson Artis", "title": "Conserving wildlife amidst a billion people: challenges and solutions"}]
[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "Last weekend, the women\u2019s water\u00a0polo team played three games, winning two and losing one. Princeton beat St. Francis and Bucknell on Saturday, but fell to No. 7 Michigan on Sunday. The Tigers now have a 3-1 overall record in the CWPA.\n\nThe first game saw Princeton fell St. Francis 10-5, with seven different players netting goals. Junior Chelsea Johnson scored two, with senior classmates Morgan Hallock and Hannah Lapkin getting two. Freshman goalkeeper Kasey Bersh made her second collegiate career start for the Tigers, making a total of four saves. The win helped create confidence going into the Bucknell game later that day.\n\nJunior Haley Wan buried a total of five goals against Bucknell which took her goal tally up to 41, to ensure Princeton beat the Bison, 9-3. Wan, the All-CWPA Second Team player, was top goal scorer for the Tigers last season, ending with\u00a058 goals. The game was not all about Princeton, though; Bucknell tested the Tigers' defense, forcing senior Ashleigh Johnson to make seven saves in the game. \n\nHowever, the weekend did not end on the note Princeton would have liked, as the Tigers lost against Michigan. Despite Ashleigh\u00a0Johnson making seven saves again, Michigan managed to score 14 points\u00a0against Princeton\u2019s six. Michigan came out strong in the first period, scoring five, and Princeton struggled to recover from the quick start, never closing the gap to take the lead. By the half, Princeton was seven goals behind. Wan scored three in the game, giving her eight hat tricks in the last nine games, while\u00a0Chelsea\u00a0Johnson got two goals.\n\nNo. 10 Princeton was disappointed by the performance on Sunday, but is having a successful season so far, at 18-3 overall. The Tigers will need to bounce back quickly as they face further CWPA competition on the road this coming weekend against two top 20 ranked teams, No. 15 Indiana and No. 19\u00a0Hartwick, as well as Ivy League-rival Brown.\n\n", "author": "Grace Baylis", "title": "Women\u2019s water polo goes 2-1 for the weekend"}]

The Tigers (6-3 EIVA, 9-8 overall) lost a hard-fought match against conference rivals NJIT (4-3, 9-7) on Friday, but quickly responded the following day to sweep Coker College, 3-0. \n\nThe EIVA conference loss to NJIT proved to be a major setback for the Princeton team. Tied last week for the top spot in the league, the Tigers have fallen to third as rivals Penn State and Sacred Heart managed to capitalize on the Princeton defeat. However, the Tigers are still in a comfortable position to secure a playoff spot.\n\nDespite strong performances from Princeton\u2019s freshman, including nine kills and four blocks from middle blocker George Huhmann, the Tigers were unable to fend off a surge from the Highlanders. NJIT started the match strong, securing the first set comfortably 25-16. While Princeton quickly rebounded in the second set, the Highlanders grabbed a thrilling 29-27 victory by the end of the set. \n\nLed by Jabarry Goodridge\u2019s 20 kills, NJIT would go on to win the third set and sweep the Tigers 3-0. \n\nComing off a disappointing performance, the Tigers hosted Coker at home. If Friday\u2019s match bothered them, the Princeton squad did not let it show on the court. The Orange and Black swept Coker in three sets, showing signs of their earlier brilliant performances. \n\nThis was a crucial win for the Tigers, as they will no doubt\u00a0carry this momentum into a six-match road trip. These games include three crucial EIVA conference games against the likes of Penn State, St. Francis, and George Mason. The Tigers will need to show their resilience and resolve as they head into hostile territory against these tough opponents. \n\nWith the playoffs hanging in the balance, fans of Princeton volleyball will have plenty to look forward to. \n\n\n\n", "author": "David Xin", "title": "Men's volleyball splits weekend against NJIT, Coker"}]
[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "On Friday, March 31, elementary school students without any previous\u00a0exposure to the field of neuroscience were guided in constructing\u00a0a network of neurons using pipe cleaners. The exercise was part of an effort by University students to expose students at the Christina Seix Academy to a field often excluded to more privileged environments. \n\nThe Princeton Neuroscience Network, a student-led group that fosters greater awareness and appreciation for neuroscience, held its first major outreach event on March 31. The fourth-grade students from Christina Seix Academy, a school founded to provide education to children from low-income, single-parent households, were brought to the Princeton Neuroscience\u00a0Institute to engage in a series of activities\u00a0about science and the brain during the University's first Neuroscience Fair.\n\n\"I liked it a lot. It taught us a lot of things we didn't know before. We went in not knowing a lot about the brain, but we came out knowing much more,\" said Serenity Davis, a student at Christina Seix.\n\nHeads of the PNN Outreach Committee Chi-Chi Azoba '18 and Selam Zenebe-Gete '18 explained that it was important to them as STEM students to spread awareness of neuroscience and to share the University's many resources.\n\n\u201cAs women of color, getting students to come here and see us perform as student leaders has been empowering\u201d Azoba explained. \n\nAzoba and Zenebe-Gete, both juniors concentrating in Molecular Biology at the University, have been planning this event since their freshman year, when they started the Outreach Committee of Princeton Neuroscience Network after meeting one of PNN\u2019s co-founders, Seong Jang \u201818. \n\n\u201cWe had this vision freshman year to expose younger students to neuroscience since neuroscience had never been introduced to us as children,\u201d Azoba noted. \n\nSince its creation two years ago, PNN has been engaging with University students through study breaks, movie screenings with professors, and research symposiums. According to Jang, however, the group felt that it was time for PNN to engage\u00a0with a wider community.\n\n\u201cWe want PNN to grow from all branches,\u201d explained Jang, referring to PNN\u2019s events, research, and outreach efforts.\n\nJang hopes that through outreach efforts such as this fair, those interested in neuroscience at the University can enhance their experiences while positively impacting the surrounding community. \n\nConsisting of a series of blocks or activities the children rotated through, the Neuroscience Fair engaged students in a variety of ways as they learned about the different parts of the brain, their functions, and how these parts of the brain affect perception and understanding. For example, one block allowed the children to watch Princeton students dissect a sheep brain, during which\u00a0PNN volunteers showed them the functions of each part of the brain. Another block allowed the children to monitor the electrical activity of muscles using a Muscle SpikerBox.\n\nStudents of Christina Seix Academy left the University not only with a stronger understanding of the brain and of the field of neuroscience, but with an appreciation for science and a desire to pursue neuroscience in the future. In addition, exposure to the University community delighted Academy students, who expressed their fascination with\u00a0the campus. \n\n\"Have you seen the movie \"Groundhog Day\"? I wish today was my groundhog day so I could come here every day!\" said Academy student Justin Hogue. \n\nSome children, according to teachers at the academy, have even set goals since their visit\u00a0of becoming students at the University someday. \n\n\"The Neuroscience Fair sparked something in our students. It made them curious and excited to learn more about their brain and learning, \" said Nicole Morillo, a teacher at Christina Seix.\n\n\"The students absolutely loved every minute of the Neuroscience Fair. It broadened their understanding and increased their enthusiasm about science,\" said Ashley Umberger, another teacher at the Academy. \n\nSeeing their project come to fruition with such success, PNN leaders said they encourage and are optimistic about their organizational\u00a0goals. One of these goals is to hold a conference here at the University that will\u00a0bring together professors, students, and researchers from other institutions who are interested in neuroscience.\n\n", "author": "Nouran Ibrahim", "title": "PNN leads elementary awareness event about neuroscience"}]
[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "In her March 29 opinion column\u00a0titled \u201cOutrage,\u201d Jacquelyn Thorbjornson demands that we be in an uproar over the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl by two of her classmates because liberal media organizations are protecting the defendants, due to their status as undocumented immigrants. The article is calling for outrage on the Maryland rape case, but more specifically the alleged failings of liberal media, itself perpetuating the unconsented exploitation of private tragedy for public, partisan attacks. A 14-year-old may have just been raped in a high school bathroom. Should the conversation on that focus on attacks on undocumented immigrants and attacks on liberal media outlets? Should we be having a national conversation on that at all?\n\nThe article disproportionately focuses on the actions and assumed motives of liberal media outlets, when the political motive of Fox News is much easier to see than the alleged liberal bias. It is sensationalizing and exploiting an alleged rape and abandoning \u201cinnocent before proven guilty\u201d to attack 11 million undocumented immigrants. The crime at hand is rape, not illegal entry. Yet the nationwide rhetoric surrounding the case now implies that individual crimes are something that we can hold other undocumented immigrants accountable for.\n\nIt is unfortunate for a case like this to reach this level of extensive national coverage before the court makes a decision. In his response to \u201cOutrage,\u201d Ryan Chavez succinctly explained why national coverage of the Brock Turner case cannot be applied to the alleged Maryland rape, for publicization happened after the case was decided and because the victim shared her testimony on Buzzfeed. Until the victim willingly steps into the public spotlight, reports on the alleged Maryland rape are not providing \u201cinformation\u201d for public debate or creating a more informed polity. Instead, we are devaluing and exploiting a 14-year-old rape victim to reinforce a stance in the undocumented immigration debate. It is understandable to feel outrage when we hear \u201c14-year-old student allegedly raped by two people.\u201d But that outrage should not go public without the consent of the victim, and it certainly should not be wielded against 11 million innocent people with a coincidental relation, like citizenship status, to the alleged wrongdoers.\n\nAlis Yoo is a sophomore from Palisades Park, N.J.

[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "It\u2019s tempting to speculate that the lingering artifacts of grade deflation are still at play on campus \u2014 when the orgo\u00a0exam is curved down, when your professor boasts about a 50 percent average on the math midterm, when the \u201cHarvard easy A\u201d jokes are forever funny. The policy of grade deflation is the common enemy and the most reliable scapegoat.\n\nAs part of the generation that never faced the policy, I am confronted with the question of its legacy. What does the failed experiment show us about our campus culture? With or without deflation, Princeton students depend on grades as a measure of self-worth. \n\nWhen I researched the policy, I expected evidence to affirm our fears: deflated grades diminished our prospects for jobs and graduate programs. But the administration\u2019s report repealing deflation attributed the discontinuation to \u201cpsychological factors and campus atmosphere,\u201d rather than effects on opportunities outside the Princeton bubble.\n\nThe policy\u2019s life and death reveal students\u2019 dependence on their GPAs for validation. Motivated by a goal to deliver \u201cclear signals from their teachers about the difference between their ordinarily good work and their very best work,\u201d the deflation policy instead heightened anxieties surrounding the letter grade, rather than what it represented. The policy forced a numerical antidote to a cultural problem. If changing the metric could not change our relationship with grades, what could?\n\nAfter the discontinuation of the policy in 2014, the Nassau Weekly reported an underwhelming, rather than celebratory, campus atmosphere. In the article, half-sarcastic students mourn, \u201cIf we\u2019re getting rid of grade deflation, we need a new excuse for poor grades.\u201d The article comments that terminating the policy \u201cultimately reinforced the idea that students\u2019 stress levels should reflect their GPAs,\u201d and calls on students to \u201ctry and divorce our transcripts from our sense of self-worth.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Janelle Tam \u201917 wrote a relatable reflection on the perpetual struggle of caring\u00a0more about your GPA than the illustrious academic pursuit, yet feeling helpless to change. She encourages an \u201cattitude change,\u201d a conscious decision to focus \u201con intellectual exploration rather than getting As.\u201d\n\nBut how much can students, as individuals, do to change the GPA-centric culture? In the administration\u2019s report, the Undergraduate Student Government suggested that the policy placed an \u201cemphasis on the letter grade rather than substantive instructor feedback.\u201d The policy sought to provide \u201cclear signals\u201d to students regarding their performance. But, to cultivate more illuminating feedback, why not give us more feedback?\n\nI am embarrassed to admit that this week, I called my mom crying after I got a politics paper back.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t really interested in the score, but I did take the commentary a little too personally, to say the least; never have I ever seen \u201cno\u2019s\u201d aggressively annotating an essay. While I got the same letter grade on an English essay and decided to P/D/F the class, the plentiful, though unpleasant, feedback on my politics essay spurred an eagerness to redeem myself on the next assignment.\n\nWhile grades are easy to dismiss and rationalize, descriptive feedback speaks to the University\u2019s mission of motivating academic excellence \u2014 a push for the student\u2019s absolute best work. \n\nGrade deflation poorly embodied this mission, but the goal could be met by having professors and preceptors\u00a0provide more guidelines and expectations for direct critique, perhaps through written comments for students accompanying midterm/final grades. In high school, we received copious and constant feedback. For better or for worse, Princeton is not high school. But,\u00a0the impact of personal feedback on a student\u2019s psyche can not be understated.\n\nHow should we distinguish good work from excellent work? Tell us. Rather than suggest a quota on grades, departments should encourage a framework of robust communication between students and professors/preceptors. The University would then return the ball to the students\u2019 court by choosing to\u00a0focus on qualitative feedback, rather than\u00a0the often uninformative mark on the transcript.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to internalize a score if a score is all you get. We\u00a0students hold a responsibility to pursue excellence rather than validation \u2013 superior work, rather than an easy A. But the administration should play a role in curing our GPA obsession and improving mental health. With a culture defined by feedback and communication rather than definitive scores, we can refocus our academic pursuits.\n\nJessica Nyquist is a sophomore from Houston, Texas.

[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "In your edition on April 3, you published an open letter to me from the Princeton Private Prison Divest Coalition. The letter raised a number of questions that I know are of interest to many members of the campus community. I have addressed those questions in the following open letter to the PPPDC.\n\nThank you for your letter on behalf of the Princeton Private Prison Divest Coalition. You are correct that the issue of divestment focuses on whether the University should prohibit any future investment or association with a specified set of companies. It is my understanding that this question remains under consideration by the CPUC Resources Committee, which, as you know, consists of three faculty members, two undergraduates, a graduate student, and two members of the administrative staff. It is that committee to which the trustees look for advice on divestment-related issues.   \n\nAt the CPUC meeting last week and on its website, the Resources Committee has invited the PPPDC to provide additional information, and it also has welcomed the views of other members of the community. My understanding is that other groups, including the Undergraduate Student Government and the Whig-Cliosophic Society, are discussing the issue, and the Resources Committee itself has at least two remaining meetings this year.\n\nAs you point out, the trustees have final authority to decide whether to divest from a particular set of companies, and they have established criteria for making that decision. Because there is a general presumption against the University taking such actions, other than in exceptional cases, the standards set a very high bar. The Resources Committee is guided by those standards in determining whether, and on what grounds, to bring forward a recommendation to the trustees. The trustees take their responsibilities very seriously, but they do not begin their decision-making process until the Resources Committee has completed its work.  \n\nYou made reference to the\u00a0statement by President Eisgruber at the CPUC meeting that the University does not hold investments in the 11 companies specified in your proposal and it does not intend to obtain such holdings. He made this statement, in part, because an\u00a0opinion column in last Monday\u2019s Daily Princetonian asserted that the University had current investments. His clarification that the University does not currently have any such investments allowed the discussion to focus on the question of policy going forward. I can assure you that the President would not have made this statement without being absolutely certain that the University, in fact, has no investments of any kind, direct or indirect, in any of the 11 companies. \n\nAs a member of the CPUC, I thought last week\u2019s update from the Resources Committee had the effect of focusing community attention on the question of divestment from private prison companies and of broadening the discussion. I appreciate the time that the members of the PPPDC have invested in this issue, and I hope that you, along with others, will engage with the committee in the continuing discussion. \n\nBob Durkee \u201969 \n\nVice President and Secretary\n\n", "author": "Guest Contributor", "title": "Letter to the Editor: Response to PPPD"}]

The group recently delivered a divestment proposal to the Council of the Princeton University Community\u2019s Resource Committee that was rejected. This was later followed by a PPPD-led walkout during the CPUC meeting last week, during which President Christopher Eisgruber \u201983 noted that the University is not invested in private prisons.\n\nTeehan stated that the proposal was crafted to meet the demands of the Resources Committee, including sustained campus support for the issue and a demonstrated conflict with University values. This included a campus-wide referendum, in which 89 percent of undergraduate and 85 percent of graduate students voted in favor of divestment. The Resources Committee nonetheless reached a consensus that it was planning to reject the proposal and failed to provide a reason with the rejection. According to Teehan, the walkout during the CPUC meeting was a reaction to this decision.\n\n\u201cWe led a walkout during the meeting so we could engage with the issue in a way that was truer to our values, and reject the legitimacy of the Resources Committee and the way the University, by extension, had been handling the issue so far,\u201d said Teehan.\n\nTeehan and Callon then opened the floor for questions from the USG Senate.\n\nU-Councilor Olivia Grah \u201919 questioned PPPD's decision to conduct the walkout before the question and answer session, in which the Resources Committee did provide reasons for the proposal's rejection. Grah stated that the session would have been an opportunity to engage with the Resources Committee in an environment where they would have been held accountable.\n\n\u201cWere [the committee] to engage in tactics of obstruction..., that would be broadly visible to everyone else attending the meeting,\u201d explained Grah.\n\nCallon replied that the PPPD members had watched the recording of the question and answer session and that they did not consider the reasons given as legitimate reasons to reject the proposal. Callon also upheld the reasoning behind the walkout itself, restating the PPPD's refusal to interact with the Resources Committee. According to Callon, this refusal is the result of over a year of working with the committee, which \u201cvery clearly has not engaged themselves fully with our proposal or with anything we say to them in our meetings.\u201d\n\nClass of 2018 Senator Eli Schechner \u201918 inquired as to what the PPPD's next steps will be following their rejection of the legitimacy of the Resources Committee.\n\nTeehan explained that action was still necessary to be able to change the way the administration interacts with student movements. Adding to this, he noted that the Resources Committee had originally disallowed a rejected proposal to be submitted again in the same academic year, but due to campus support for the divestment issue, the Committee had since indicated that the policy was to be changed.\n\nSocial Committee Chair Lavinia Liang \u201918 presented an update on current committee projects. The projects include the Artist of the Year Competition (formerly known as Battle of the Bands). The competition will accept audio submissions of any genre until Friday, April 7. Voting will open for the entire undergraduate body from April 10 - April 14, and the winner will be announced April 17. The Social Committee will also be hosting Coachella on the Lawn, an outdoor showing of the Coachella music festival on April 21 in a location that is to be determined. Liang also mentioned that the Lawnparties reveal will occur sometime next week.\n\n", "author": "Jason Fu", "title": "USG meeting discusses private prison divestment"}]
[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "The Honorable Sonia Sotomayor \u201976 believes that service is of utmost importance, no matter what form it takes \u2014 and she urged her listeners to make giving back a central part of their lives. \n\nCaptivating the audience with her signature humility, wit, and confidence, Sotomayor shared her insights and advice with a crowd of University alumni and current students on April 1 as part of a conference on the history and experiences of Latino students and alumni at the University. Sotomayor is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and is the first Latina to hold this title.\n\nAccompanied by University Trustee Margarita Rosa \u201974, Sotomayor first recounted her experience at the University, telling stories of how others have impacted her personal and professional narratives. She also fielded questions from the audience, walking among audience members on the floor of Richardson Auditorium. As she gave responses, she posed for photos and hugged enthusiastic audience members.  \n\nAudience member Angie Freeland \u201911 expressed her admiration for Sotomayor. Freeland said that as a young attorney, she saw Sotomayor as a personal inspiration and \u201can inspiration for the Latino community and to young women across the country.\u201d\n\nIn Sotomayor\u2019s discussion with Rosa, the first Hispanic and first female to serve as the commissioner of New York State Division of Human Rights, she highlighted that everyone has at least one thing in common: we have someone to guide us. Thus, everyone should pay it forward \u2014 we should be the ones to guide someone else, she said, addressing audience members. \n\n\u201cSomeone or something happened to give us that break,\u201d Sotomayor explained. \u201cSomeone who saw something within us and guided us.\u201d \n\nWith this in mind, she posed the question, \u201cHow many of us in this room are actively, every\u00a0day looking for that life within a touch?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a continuing obligation to ensure that we\u2019re actively seeking out those that need that touch forward.\u201d\n\nDescribing her time as an undergraduate, Sotomayor explained that she would sometimes find herself feeling alienated or confused by certain social or cultural aspects of campus given her humble upbringing. \n\n\u201cI guess what I learned to do at Princeton was to ask questions. And that has helped me throughout my entire life. What I didn\u2019t know, I asked,\u201d she said. \u201cI continue to say that every day I learn things I didn\u2019t know and I see it as an advantage.\u201d\n\nSotomayor addressed her role in changing the University\u2019s unofficial motto in Oct. 2016 from \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and in the service of all nations\u201d to \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and the service of humanity.\u201d In her contributions, she explained how she considered what service and community meant to her on both personal and global scales. \n\n\u201cService to me meant what my life has been. It\u2019s caring, it\u2019s giving, and that\u2019s where the phrase \u2018service in the name of humanity\u2019 came from,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we start there, everything else good will follow.\u201d\n\nSotomayor emphasized the importance of service throughout one's life, no matter the form it takes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how you serve. I just want you to serve,\" she said. \n\nSotomayor\u2019s role on the Supreme Court prevents her from answering questions that could compromise her impartiality as a judge. Therefore people's questions\u00a0sought Sotomayor\u2019s advice on character and life rather than her opinions on the current political climate.\n\nWhen asked what she was most proud of in her life, she addressed her deep connection with her family and those who have touched her life.\n\n\u201cWhat am I the proudest of? That I\u2019ve never walked alone. That all of the people who I have known have taken every step with me,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we are looking back and celebrating what we have accomplished but also at the same time carrying out what still needs to be done,\u201d Freeland said about the conference's importance. \n\nSotomayor spoke during the conference \u201c\u00a1Adelante Tigres! Celebrating Latino Alumni at Princeton University\u201d March 30 through April 1. The conference featured presentations, alumni discussion groups, networking opportunities, campus tours, and social events. Featured speakers included President Christopher Eisgruber \u201983, American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero \u201987, and Secretary of the State of Rhode Island Nellie Gorbea \u201988.\n\nContributor Jane Sul contributed reporting to this article.\n\n", "author": "Emily Spalding", "title": "The Hon.
