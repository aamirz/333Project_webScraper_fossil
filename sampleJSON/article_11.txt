[{"date": "Apr 3, 2017", "body": "The Honorable Sonia Sotomayor \u201976 believes that service is of utmost importance, no matter what form it takes \u2014 and she urged her listeners to make giving back a central part of their lives. \n\nCaptivating the audience with her signature humility, wit, and confidence, Sotomayor shared her insights and advice with a crowd of University alumni and current students on April 1 as part of a conference on the history and experiences of Latino students and alumni at the University. Sotomayor is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and is the first Latina to hold this title.\n\nAccompanied by University Trustee Margarita Rosa \u201974, Sotomayor first recounted her experience at the University, telling stories of how others have impacted her personal and professional narratives. She also fielded questions from the audience, walking among audience members on the floor of Richardson Auditorium. As she gave responses, she posed for photos and hugged enthusiastic audience members.  \n\nAudience member Angie Freeland \u201911 expressed her admiration for Sotomayor. Freeland said that as a young attorney, she saw Sotomayor as a personal inspiration and \u201can inspiration for the Latino community and to young women across the country.\u201d\n\nIn Sotomayor\u2019s discussion with Rosa, the first Hispanic and first female to serve as the commissioner of New York State Division of Human Rights, she highlighted that everyone has at least one thing in common: we have someone to guide us. Thus, everyone should pay it forward \u2014 we should be the ones to guide someone else, she said, addressing audience members. \n\n\u201cSomeone or something happened to give us that break,\u201d Sotomayor explained. \u201cSomeone who saw something within us and guided us.\u201d \n\nWith this in mind, she posed the question, \u201cHow many of us in this room are actively, every\u00a0day looking for that life within a touch?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a continuing obligation to ensure that we\u2019re actively seeking out those that need that touch forward.\u201d\n\nDescribing her time as an undergraduate, Sotomayor explained that she would sometimes find herself feeling alienated or confused by certain social or cultural aspects of campus given her humble upbringing. \n\n\u201cI guess what I learned to do at Princeton was to ask questions. And that has helped me throughout my entire life. What I didn\u2019t know, I asked,\u201d she said. \u201cI continue to say that every day I learn things I didn\u2019t know and I see it as an advantage.\u201d\n\nSotomayor addressed her role in changing the University\u2019s unofficial motto in Oct. 2016 from \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and in the service of all nations\u201d to \u201cPrinceton in the nation\u2019s service and the service of humanity.\u201d In her contributions, she explained how she considered what service and community meant to her on both personal and global scales. \n\n\u201cService to me meant what my life has been. It\u2019s caring, it\u2019s giving, and that\u2019s where the phrase \u2018service in the name of humanity\u2019 came from,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we start there, everything else good will follow.\u201d\n\nSotomayor emphasized the importance of service throughout one's life, no matter the form it takes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how you serve. I just want you to serve,\" she said. \n\nSotomayor\u2019s role on the Supreme Court prevents her from answering questions that could compromise her impartiality as a judge. Therefore people's questions\u00a0sought Sotomayor\u2019s advice on character and life rather than her opinions on the current political climate.\n\nWhen asked what she was most proud of in her life, she addressed her deep connection with her family and those who have touched her life.\n\n\u201cWhat am I the proudest of? That I\u2019ve never walked alone. That all of the people who I have known have taken every step with me,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we are looking back and celebrating what we have accomplished but also at the same time carrying out what still needs to be done,\u201d Freeland said about the conference's importance. \n\nSotomayor spoke during the conference \u201c\u00a1Adelante Tigres! Celebrating Latino Alumni at Princeton University\u201d March 30 through April 1. The conference featured presentations, alumni discussion groups, networking opportunities, campus tours, and social events. Featured speakers included President Christopher Eisgruber \u201983, American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero \u201987, and Secretary of the State of Rhode Island Nellie Gorbea \u201988.\n\nContributor Jane Sul contributed reporting to this article.\n\n", "author": "Emily Spalding", "title": "The Hon.
