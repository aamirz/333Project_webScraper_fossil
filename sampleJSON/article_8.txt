        "body": "It\u2019s tempting to speculate that the lingering artifacts of grade deflation are still at play on campus \u2014 when the orgo\u00a0exam is curved down, when your professor boasts about a 50 percent average on the math midterm, when the \u201cHarvard easy A\u201d jokes are forever funny. The policy of grade deflation is the common enemy and the most reliable scapegoat.\n\nAs part of the generation that never faced the policy, I am confronted with the question of its legacy. What does the failed experiment show us about our campus culture? With or without deflation, Princeton students depend on grades as a measure of self-worth. \n\nWhen I researched the policy, I expected evidence to affirm our fears: deflated grades diminished our prospects for jobs and graduate programs. But the administration\u2019s report repealing deflation attributed the discontinuation to \u201cpsychological factors and campus atmosphere,\u201d rather than effects on opportunities outside the Princeton bubble.\n\nThe policy\u2019s life and death reveal students\u2019 dependence on their GPAs for validation. Motivated by a goal to deliver \u201cclear signals from their teachers about the difference between their ordinarily good work and their very best work,\u201d the deflation policy instead heightened anxieties surrounding the letter grade, rather than what it represented. The policy forced a numerical antidote to a cultural problem. If changing the metric could not change our relationship with grades, what could?\n\nAfter the discontinuation of the policy in 2014, the Nassau Weekly reported an underwhelming, rather than celebratory, campus atmosphere. In the article, half-sarcastic students mourn, \u201cIf we\u2019re getting rid of grade deflation, we need a new excuse for poor grades.\u201d The article comments that terminating the policy \u201cultimately reinforced the idea that students\u2019 stress levels should reflect their GPAs,\u201d and calls on students to \u201ctry and divorce our transcripts from our sense of self-worth.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Janelle Tam \u201917 wrote a relatable reflection on the perpetual struggle of caring\u00a0more about your GPA than the illustrious academic pursuit, yet feeling helpless to change. She encourages an \u201cattitude change,\u201d a conscious decision to focus \u201con intellectual exploration rather than getting As.\u201d\n\nBut how much can students, as individuals, do to change the GPA-centric culture? In the administration\u2019s report, the Undergraduate Student Government suggested that the policy placed an \u201cemphasis on the letter grade rather than substantive instructor feedback.\u201d The policy sought to provide \u201cclear signals\u201d to students regarding their performance. But, to cultivate more illuminating feedback, why not give us more feedback?\n\nI am embarrassed to admit that this week, I called my mom crying after I got a politics paper back.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t really interested in the score, but I did take the commentary a little too personally, to say the least; never have I ever seen \u201cno\u2019s\u201d aggressively annotating an essay. While I got the same letter grade on an English essay and decided to P/D/F the class, the plentiful, though unpleasant, feedback on my politics essay spurred an eagerness to redeem myself on the next assignment.\n\nWhile grades are easy to dismiss and rationalize, descriptive feedback speaks to the University\u2019s mission of motivating academic excellence \u2014 a push for the student\u2019s absolute best work. \n\nGrade deflation poorly embodied this mission, but the goal could be met by having professors and preceptors\u00a0provide more guidelines and expectations for direct critique, perhaps through written comments for students accompanying midterm/final grades. In high school, we received copious and constant feedback. For better or for worse, Princeton is not high school. But,\u00a0the impact of personal feedback on a student\u2019s psyche can not be understated.\n\nHow should we distinguish good work from excellent work? Tell us. Rather than suggest a quota on grades, departments should encourage a framework of robust communication between students and professors/preceptors. The University would then return the ball to the students\u2019 court by choosing to\u00a0focus on qualitative feedback, rather than\u00a0the often uninformative mark on the transcript.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to internalize a score if a score is all you get. We\u00a0students hold a responsibility to pursue excellence rather than validation \u2013 superior work, rather than an easy A. But the administration should play a role in curing our GPA obsession and improving mental health. With a culture defined by feedback and communication rather than definitive scores, we can refocus our academic pursuits.\n\nJessica Nyquist is a sophomore from Houston, Texas.
